# RaspberryPi-Emotion-Dectector
Our Project won a prize for the 2020 Hack n Roll Hackathon.

Our smart glasses allow the visually impaired to recognise other people’s emotions through computer vision, emotion recognition and audio feedback.

## Problem
In a world where relationships with people form a big part of our lives, people who are visually impaired often face a disadvantage. Currently, there are 285 million visually impaired individuals worldwide. 

We want to create a tool to help improve their interpersonal relationships and make better connections with others through understanding their emotions.

We realised later during our research that those with difficulty interpreting social cues and signals such as those with Asperger’s Syndrome and autism would also benefit greatly from having such an innovation. In fact, 1 in 160 children has an autism spectrum disorder of some sort.

This will allow them to improve their interpersonal relationships with their family and friends by providing them a technologically assistive avenue to enable understand the world around them.  

To clarify, we see this not as a replacement for their current methods of perception, but as an augmentation.
